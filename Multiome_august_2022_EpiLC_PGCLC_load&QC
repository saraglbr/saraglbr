#Load the data------------------------------------------------------------

Prior to this: Fastq files were obtained cellranger-arc mkfastq (run by western general facility). Cellranger-arc count was then run for each sample (PGCLC and EpiLC) and results were aggregated through the cell ranger aggr pipeline (cellranger-arc aggr). You need to specify the DIRECTORY where the outputs are, usually names as "outs". 
Cell ranger runs through command line, code can be found at http://129.215.159.174//reports/index.php?title=Sara_Multiome

##Counts and fragpath-----------------------
```{r}

counts <- Read10X_h5("/mnt/tchandra-lab/Sara/projects/Multiome/aggr/aggr_EpilC_PGCLC/outs/filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5")
fragpath <- "/mnt/tchandra-lab/Sara/projects/Multiome/aggr/aggr_EpilC_PGCLC/outs/atac_fragments.tsv.gz"

```
